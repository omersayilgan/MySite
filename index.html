            <p>My name is Ömer, and I was born in 1999. I graduated from METU with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I also completed a minor in Mechatronics Engineering. During my time at METU, I expanded my knowledge by taking courses in both Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering.</p>
            <p>Although my background is in Mechanical Engineering, I have a strong passion for electronics and coding. My interest in these areas led me to work in the Turkish Defence Industry for 9 months, where I focused on Control Engineering. Throughout this experience, I extensively used MATLAB/Simulink, and I am now highly proficient in these tools. </p>
            <p>I learned German at the B1 level at the Goethe-Institut Ankara 6 years ago. Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to study in Germany. Additionally, I have always been fascinated by aircraft, which is why I am currently pursuing my MSc in Aerospace at TUM.</p>
